# Basic example 
In this example we'll run a BWAS analysis using functional connectivity as brain features. Resulting \\( \beta\\)-weights will be used to predict the corresponding brain-derived behavioral scores. Here we assume you have succesfully downloaded the toolbox and associated data. 

**Considerations**:

- This is a toy example that uses a reduced sample to ilustrate the functionality of the toolbox
- The same dataset is used to calculate the models and to predict scores. You should not do this in a real project.
