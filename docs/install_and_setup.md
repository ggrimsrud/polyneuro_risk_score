# Installation

## Matlab

## Using a container

You can run the container version of this toolbox. To do it, you need to:

1. Make sure you have [singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html) in your system. Here are [instructions on how to install it](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html).
2. Download the container.
3. Run it from terminal. See detailed instructions in the provided examples that run a BWAS using functional connectivity and cortical thickness data.
4. Memory and execution time varies depending on the number of brain features and participants, you might need to request resources using slurm. See section for some examples about time and memory needs.
