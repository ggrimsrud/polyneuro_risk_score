# Brain Wide Associations and PolyNeuro Risk Scores

Here we describe how to use the toolbox we developed to calculate Brain Wide Associations and PolyNeuro Risk Scores. This is an implementation in Matlab of the methodology proposed by [Zhao, *et. al*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33145600/). This set of [slides](./intro/BWAS_brain_features_behavior_biostats_JC.pdf) describes in more detail the rationale for this approach and presents some of the figures made by the toolbox.


The documentation describes how to install the toolbox, run an analysis and explore the corresponding results, both using Matlab and the containarized version of the toolbox. If you use this toolbox please cite the following reference **to be populated**
