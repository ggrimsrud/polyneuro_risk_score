- Overview
- Basic Example
    - Estimating beta-weights
    - Estimating risk
    - Exploring the outputs
- Going deeper estimating beta-weights 
    - Case 1, ignoring covariates
    - Case 2, including covariates per brain feature
    - Case 3, removing the effect of covariates before calculating the beta-weights (pre-whitening)
    - Comparing outputs
        - ciftis
        - beta-weights
        - explained variance
    - Closing remarks and recomendations

    - longitudinal analyses
    - Predicting categorical outcomes
    - for fconn make seed ciftis with sum of weights
